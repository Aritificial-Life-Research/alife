ALife V0.12
===========

This is just one of many projects creating 'artificial life', wherefrom emeregent behaviour may arise. Unlike many related projects, the sprites in this one do not rely entirely on evolution to improve their behaviour, but use (relatively basic) reinforcement learning techinques in order to evolve useful behavious inside of one generation.
